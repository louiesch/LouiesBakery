8:23am a little confused on how naming and linking everything up is gonna work with two classes and two test files, so doing some google searching
9am still unsure if I need 1 or 2 test files. Will stick to using 1
10am struggling to get the buy 2 get 1 bread logic to work
11:15am still trying to get the 3 for $5 pastry logic to work
11:40am working on readme instead so im still doing something. will return to pastry logic after lunch.
12:55 still cant get it to work. Scrapping the logic and trying something else
1:20 I just cant wrap my head around how to deal with a number of pastries larger than 3!
edit: got it.

2:57 I was on to the UI when I realized my math for the bread cost was wrong. Gotta go back now.

Figured I would give credit to what helped me solve the bread logic by giving me the idea to make a variable for the free bread recieved: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10696556/special-logic-algorithm-in-shopping-cart
